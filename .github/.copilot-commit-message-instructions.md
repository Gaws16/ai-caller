# AI Commit Message Instructions

## Use Always English Language

## Title

- Short and descriptive
- Use format: "update [file_name]", "create [file_name]", "delete [file_name]", "fix [issue]" or multiple starting from most important change: "update [file_name], create [file_name], delete [file_name]"
- Start with a lowercase verb (update, create, fix, refactor, add)

Examples:

- create pages/dashboard/owner/coaches/index.vue
- update pages/dashboard/owner/coaches/edit/[id].vue
- delete pages/dashboard/owner/coaches/index.vue
- update pages/dashboard/owner/coaches/edit/[id].vue, add assets/images/logo.png, delete components/old-button.vue
- update pages/teams/index.vue,add pages/teams/details/[id].vue
- add comments components/header.vue
- fix bug pages/auth/login.vue not handling errors
- Hide Edit Product button for users

## Description

- Use a numbered list
- Each point should be specific and concise
- Start each point with a verb
- Example:

```
1. Added new sidebar dropdown "View As"
2. Add console logs
3. Remove "LoginWithApple" function
4. Update button text
5. Fix navigation styles
6. Fix bug not loading profile page properly
```

## Guidelines

- Use English language to generate commit messages
- Focus on what changed, not why
- Group related changes into single points
- Mention specific component/function names
- Keep the total description under 5 points
- Use 50 characters max
- Dont over explain. Short and clear is always better. 1 short sentence max
